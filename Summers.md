Over the summer I had an internship at Lockheed Martin where I coded missiles & some other stuff. Meanwhile, I also worked on an app on nights and weekends that I plan to put on the appstore by the end of September. Once the internship ended I also finished writing a paper with Dr. Wu about a research project we worked on last year for Lockheed and Cisco.
